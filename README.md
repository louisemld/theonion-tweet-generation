# "The Onion" tweet generation

By Louise MERLAUD and Sebastien MILLET


Objective : The Onion is parodic news website, aimed at creating funny news stories. On its twitter page, the Onion gives the headlines of its articles with a link to its page. Each headline is thus freely available and a humorous take on the news.
Given the parodic nature of their headlines, we want to attempt to generate new headlines by building a model that can automatically generate a tweet given the first word. 

To do so, we have obtained all the tweets from @TheOnion (around 75,000 tweets). 



## Word preprocessing 


## Model : LSTM
