# "The Onion" tweet generation

By Louise MERLAUD and Sebastien MILLET


Objective : The Onion is parodic news website, aimed at creating funny news stories. On its twitter page, the Onion gives the headlines of its articles with a link to its page. Each headline is thus freely available and a humorous take on the news.
Given the parodic nature of their headlines, we want to attempt to generate new headlines by building a model that can automatically generate a tweet given the first word. 

To do so, we have obtained all the tweets from @TheOnion (around 75,000 tweets) but only use 33% of it for performance.

Our approach will use a Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory model in order to generate the headlines.

## Word preprocessing 

### Cleaning and tokenization
We first import all the tweets in a Pandas and clean them by removing special characters. We then proceed to a tokenization of the sentences by establishing a dictionnary for the characters, and its inverse dictionnary for the indexes generated. This will allow us to go from text to vectors and from vectors to text.

### Sentence creation

Our aim is to predict the following characters after a given to create a headline. Therefore, we need to train the model to predict what the next character is. We create sentences of length 50 characters, and then go through the entire dataset step by step using a sliding filter. We thus give N characters and want to predict the N+1 character. 



## Model : LSTM

Long Short Term Memory is a type of Recurrent Neural Network, avoiding the long-term dependencies problem. Instead of having one single neural network layer, we have 4 of them, which interact between each other.

The cell state is the horizontal line running through the top of the diagram. The LSTM model can add or remove information to this line, and is regulated by gates. The gate has the ability to decide which component is important or not to let through. 
We have 3 types of gates : Forget, Input and Output

The first one indicates how much of the past to remember

The second one tells us how much to include of the input in the model

The last one gives us the part of the cell output to keep
